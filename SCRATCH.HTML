<br>S4:
<br>Push it to the limit. Walk along the razor's edge, but don't look down, just keep your head, or you'll be finished. Open up the limit. Past the point of no return, you've reached the top, but still you gotta learn how to keep it. Hit the wheel and double the stakes. Throttle wide open like a bat outta hell you crash the gates. Crash the gates. Going, for, the back of beyond. Nothing's gonna stop you, there's nothing that strong. So close now, you're nearly at the brink so push it! Ooh yeah!
