Great job! I just wanted to tell you that you're doing great - really, really fantasticly great. Will you marry me? I'm so proud of you. I admire your tenacity and intelligence. You're amazing.  Will you take me to the beach? You have but to speak my name and all my heart will be set aflutter. Oh, be my love, for no one else can end this yearning. This need that you and you alone create. Just fill my arms. The way you've filled my dreams. The dreams that you inspire. With every sweet desire. Could this beauty last forever? I would ask for nothing more, believe me! Could I hear this song forever? Calling to my heart anew. my Darling. While I drift along forever. Lost. in a dream. of you.
