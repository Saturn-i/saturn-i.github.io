--Notes:{ 
--{Excercises:

Tone Building Excercises 1 and 2{
	The exercise is this: start on any note (let’s use Bottom D) and, with a big lungful of air, start the note as softly as possible, whisper-soft. Then steadily and slowly increase the volume of the note until it’s as loud as you can possibly play it without the note breaking, then steadily and slowly decrease the volume until whisper-soft again. All on one unbroken breath or stream of air.

It is extremely important to KEEP THE PITCH OF THE NOTE EXACTLY THE SAME throughout the exercise. Look at the needle on an electronic tuner and keep the needle pointing straight up throughout the exercise. Obviously when playing D very softly you will have to compensate for its potential flatness by adjusting your embouchure, likewise when playing D at maximum volume you will have to compensate for its potential sharpness with your embouchure.

In my opinion doing this exercise on Bottom D is the single best tone-building thing I’ve ever done. If you have more time you can work your way up the scale and do the same exercise on every note, but even if you only do it on bottom D you’ll find that your tone gets better throughout the range, with more focus and a more powerful and liquid tone.

The other helpful tonebuilding exercise is to alternate bottom D with other notes, played rather slowly, with NO TONGUING (played legato, or slurred) like this

DE DF# DG DA DB DC Dd De Df# Dg Da Db

If you can slur between a powerful booming Bottom D and a sweet clear high B it shows that you have a flexible embouchure ready to handle anything Irish flute music hands your way.
	
}
{more excercises


Here are more embouchure exercises. Some of it overlaps with what Richard has posted or is a variant.

Long tones—play your best middle D you can, then slur it to a C#, trying to make both notes the best you can. When you’re happy with the match, play the best C# you can. Then slur C# to C. Get a good C, slur to B, etc., on down to low D. You can also do this in the second octave, either progressing up from middle D, or down from the high B. (You can start this excercise on most any note.)

The next step is octave slurs. Play a good low G, the let a high G grow out of it (if you want, fall back to the low G then.). Play a good low A, let the high A form, then do the same on B. Go back to the G, and do the same thing, this time working down to the low D. (Remember—the middle range, from roughly low G to maybe high G is the easiest part of the flute. The high and low extremes are more difficult.) You can also combine the long tones and octave slurs into one excercise, if you like.

Then, to expand flexibility and range, play middle D, then C#, D then C natural, D then B, D then A, D then G, D then F#, D then E, D then low D. Then go up: middle D to E, D to F#, etc. The farther apart the notes are, the harder it is. You can start this excercise on any note and work up and down from that "home base" note. For instance, start on low G, work down to low D, then work up from the G (G to A, G to B, G to C natural, G to C#, etc.) Eventually, you want to be able to jump from high B down to low D, and vice versa. Over time, this excercise will give you the ability to jump cleanly between any two notes.

With all these excercises, take your time, play as much as sounds good (your range will expand over time), and make each note the best you can. Also, once you’re comfortable, try these excercises at different
dynamics: normal, soft, loud. I wouldn’t use an electronic tuner all the time, but it’s good check your intonation from time to time.

One of the best ways to strengthen your lips is by practicing harmonics. There are lots of ways to do this, but a good one is to play a scale based on harmonics. This is a little tricky at first, so don’t force it. If you can’t make it all the way to the top, don’t. Eventually you will be able to. Here’s the scale: D E F# G A B C# D, starting in the second octave (middle D) and playing up to the third octave D. Here’s how it’s fingered, low to high:

D xxxxxx
E xxxxxo
F# xxxxoo
G xxxooo
A xxxxxx
B xxxxxo
C# xxxxoo
D xxxooo

The only "real" fingerings you’re using are for the first four notes of the scale, then you start playing harmonics, instead of the actual note you’re fingering. Don’t blow harder for the high notes, just a bit faster (smaller lip opening) and aim the air a little bit higher (not as much into the flute). You may want to begin by using the normal fingering for the note and then switch to the harmonic fingering. For instance, finger the high A xxoooo, then xxxxxx. High C# fingered oooooo will be flat, so don’t sweat it (0xxx00 or a key will bring up the pitch). The standard fingering for the high D is oxxooo. The standard fingerings vent the notes better than the harmonic fingerings do, which is why the notes are easier to hit using normal fingerings. This is a pretty good lip work-out, so make sure you balance it out with lower exercises.

--{On Playing Songs with Lyrics:
I've been struggling with what to do for songs like this for a while, and I just found the answer in the form of a girl playing the song lean on me on guitar. She didn't sing any lyrics, she just played the melody, but instead of playing the notes which correspond exactly to the words of the song, she improvised an interesting melody and combined that with the base melody of the song. This is a very good solution to this problem. If you want to watch that again, see "Lean on me cover.mp4" in the Irish Flute folder.

Practice these fingerings
Bb4: [XOX XXX]
Bb5: [XXO XXX]
(you can also use Bb5: [XOX OOO], but it's not as good)
Note that here the Bb5 first listed is the same fingering as the G#4, the only difference being that you have to overblow it.
G#4: [XXO XXX]
G#5: [XX% OOO]
it's easier to half hole the second octave notes, so don't worry about half holing G#5.
F4:  [XXX X%X] (actually i think that XXX X%O is better than this, because if you don't blow right then it comes out sounding too flat and quiet, but if you blow the normal way to do F natural and you mess is up, it just sounds like an F#)
F5:  [XXX X%O]
Eb4: [XXX XX%]
Eb5: [XXX XX%]
Eb6: [OXX OXX]


Bb5 is 932.33, try XOX OOO
XOX OOO gives us 954



04) Bb: [XOX XXX] OR [X%O OOO]
06) G#: [XXO XXX] OR [XX% OOO]
09) F:  [XXX X%X] OR [XXX X%O]

i'm not sure if i should stick with XXX X%O or switch to XXX X%X. The second one is lower, and thus more accurate, and it takes a much more open half hole. I don't know if the hold being more open means it will be easier to use or not. I've just taken both XXX X%O and XXX X%X for a test run, and I have to say that I prefer XXX X%X. It's easier to get a semi-decent tone out of that fingering, whereas the other one is just bad. yeah, XXX X%X is really much better.


11) Eb: [XXX XX%]

XXX XX% gives us 320
XX% XXX gives us a good Eb5, but not Eb4
Eb4 is 311.13 hz

//FROM PETE KOSELS PAGE:
	"The Arcane Mysteries of Third-Octave Fingering 
	Most of the time a six-hole flute is considered to be a two-octave instrument.  However, it is fairly easy to sound the lowest note in the third octave, and other notes in the third octave can usually also be produced.  The fingerings required, however, have little relationship to those used in the first and second octave and depend strongly on facilitating harmonics.  The following chart shows some third-octave fingerings that I scrounged from fingering charts for different sorts of flutes and tested more-or-less on flutes I've made.  The fingerings for D, E and F# are the only ones I use much but the others seem to work when the wind is right and I'm feeling lucky.
	D    oxxoxx (best) or oxxxxx 
	D#   xxoxxx 
	E    xxooxx (best) or xxooox 
	F    xxxxxo 
	F#   xoxxox (best) or xxxxox 
	G    xoxoox (best) or xoxooo or ooxxxx 
	G#   ooxooo or ooxoo? 
	A    oxxxxx or oxxxxo 
	A#   xxooxx or ??? 
	B    xDoooo or xoxoxo "

//Flute Keys and What They Mean:
D flutes are said to play music in the keys of: D, E minor, G, and B minor. But what on Earth does that even mean? Well, if you look at the holes on the D flute, without using any half holing, they produce the notes D E F# G A B and C#. Those notes also happen to be the exact notes on the D scale. And by the way, the D scale is also called D Major, it's the same thing, but it's not the same as D minor. So what notes are in the E minor scale, that our flute would somehow naturally be suited for it? Apparently the E minor scale is E, F#, G, A, B, C, and D, in that order - the same notes in a different order, except the C which is no longer sharp. And the G scale? G, A, B, C, D, E, and F# - again, no sharp C, but otherwise pretty much the same. What about B minor?  B, C#, D, E, F#, G, and A. Okay okay, so that's all well and good, but let's look at a scale that's supposed to be NOT especially well suited for a D flute, such as for example A major:  A, B, C#, D, E, F#, and G#. Or F minor:  F, G, A♭, B♭, C, D♭, and E♭. So for A major you would have to constantly be half holing that A key in order to produce the G#, which would be "A Major" pain in the ass. And for F minor you'd have to half hole the G key, the A key, use some sort of voodoo black magic to produce a D♭ (which I'm not even sure you can make on a D flute), and do your best to try to squeeze out an E♭, which on Doug Tipples flute fingering page, under the fingering for E♭ he just says "forget it". So what happens if you do pick up some music in an inaccessable key and try to play it? Well, you might be able to half hole sufficently that you are able to play the piece, (and here's a piece of information for you that's really important: I'm pretty sure that whenever a scale that uses for example A♭, B♭, and D# call for A, B, or D, they really are telling you to produce an A♭, B♭, or D#), but if you can't half hole it the best you can hope for is a close approximation to the song you wanted to play - which is maybe not always so terrible after all.


//Octave Changes
I've been working on producing clean notes in the second octave today, and the best that I can tell you about how to do this is that it really seems to have more to do with where your tongue is and how hard you're blowing than anything else. That tongue seems most important. You sort of push your tongue farther forward than normal, but it seems like the tip of your tongue only goes so far forward. If you look at your face, and you look at where your lips just begin to turn red, you can imagine that there's a line there. Now if you imagined that there was a line at the same place on the inside of your lips, then the tip of your tongue goes about halfway between that line and the top edge of the inside of the lip. It really is difficult to describe things better than that. But I can tell you that the hardest note to make cleanly in the second octave seems to be the D, so if you're looking for the second octave, try looking from G. Now, although I'm blowing hard to get this effect, I can tell you that my mouth is so small that really only the tiniest amount of air is escaping. Probably much less air is escaping my mouth in playing the second octave cleanly than playing even the first octave. Think about that, because when you hear people talking about overblowing, you'd think it would be the other way around. You do blow hard, but that's because your mouth is shut hard, and only the tiniest little bit of air actually gets out. Once you do get it, try playing greensleeves really slowly. That's a real workout holding your tongue like that. Here's some additional food for thought. It kind of seems to me that when I make this second octave embochure, rather than having my lips in the shape of a small circle, they're really very flat. And maybe putting my tongue forward like that is a way to make the opening that the air has to travel through even smaller, so that it comes out harder.

Consider this. Probably what's going on inside your mouth as you attempt to form your embochure is not as important as the opening formed by the lips. I think that what's really going on in the embochure i described earlier is that by placing my tongue forward and my lips flat together when i breathe out the breath is being directionalized by the tongue and given just enough force by it to just barely part the lips a little bit, which means that every time i breathe out it's creating this teeny tiny opening, which is actually closed when i'm not exhaling. So, rather than trying to push my tongue forward and tense it, try putting the tongue even farther forward, but keep it loose. put the tongue all the way forward so that it touches the inner edge of the top of the lip. just where the lips come together, that's where the tip of the tongue should be. and keep your mouth as loose as you can in that position, and push out just enough air so that your breath naturally parts your lips. That's what I'm doing now and it's not only easier to do but more controlable. But when you first try to do this there is a tendancy for the lips to be too open, so make sure you pull that top lip down so the lips are flat and together. Practice that. Try not to worry about the tongue at all, focus on the lips and the breath. And another thing, when you do it like this, where the tongue is deemphasized, you'll notice that now the D note is easy to play, but the A and B become difficult. Well, just remember that when you get to the A and B to push out more air. For those two notes you really need to crank up the air pressure. 

Well, here I am, and it's the next morning after writing all the preceding advice. Now, the thing I notice is, it's hard. Even with all that advice, this is still quite difficult. But I found another approach this morning that might be a little better. Rather than worrying anything about your embochure or tongue position or anything, I suggest you try a trick. Right now, if you make a 'p' sound over and over again, you'll notice that your lips naturally come forward similar to the embochures I was describing yesterday and and your breath shoots out quite hard. Well, when you go to play a high note, try making a 'p' sound every time you do. And you can actually start a string of notes with a 'p' sound like GEFDF and only have to make a 'p' sound once at the first G, and then you just sort of sustain your breathing and embochure position like that all the way through to the last F. Now, making a 'p' sound is definately a good way to get a clean B and A note. I also kind of feel like if you've initiated a string of notes (ABDFE) with the p sound, then you may be able to get away with initiating the next stream (EDFGB) from the same mouth position, but without making that p sound again, even if there's been some pause between the notes. Above all, try to avoid that tight smiling embochure. The corners of the mouth have to come down as much as they can, you should be frowning, or have a straight line for a mouth, not smiling. Oh, another thing is, as soon as you do make that p sound, your lips will be open a very tiny amount - try to open them a little more. When your lips are open the space of only 1 atom, the note is going to be too sharp, so as soon as you can, try to open those lips just a little more.

Okay, now this is really a different approach, but it seems to be working. Forget about the p sound, and forget about that tight embochure, rather, try to whistle into the flute.

//An Essential Tip About Reading Music
If you look at the treble clef, you'll see a bunch of lines and probably some musical notes splayed across them, and you're supposed to automatically know based on where the musical note is what note it's signifying that you must play. You'll remember that you learned that the lines spell out (from the bottom up) EGBDF, or Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge, and the spaces between the lines spell out FACE. Well, guess what, that's confusing as hell and there's a much much much simpler way to cognize this stuff. Quite simply, if you look at the lines and spaces IN ACTUAL MOTHERFUCKING ORDER, you'll notice that they're in alphabetical order, and they repeat. So the bottom line is E, then the space above that is F, and the line above that is G, and after the G we start back at A again on the next space up. Now, here's the trick. If you look at the bottom line, you can imagine that there's an invisible line below that. So, it goes bottom line, then a space below that, then we have our invisible line. And that invisible line is middle C. It's always middle C. So now we can locate middle C, and we can just look at the lines and spaces going up from there and we can quickly identify them as D,E,F,G,A,B,C,D,E,F,G.

Alright, so what else do we know from this? Well, we've already said that there are 5 lines in the treble clef, and that the notes on and between (around) those lines go in repeating alphabetical order. Well, it would be helpful - wouldn't it? - if we could know off the top of our heads what the top line was, or the middle line, or the bottom line. First, the middle line, line 3 of 5, is a high B. The top line is a high F. And the bottom line is the low E. So, if you take any of those notes, the space beneath that line is the note that comes before it, and the one above it is the note that comes after it. In other words, from that high B, the spot below it is A and the spot after it is C. Easy, right? If you remember anything, remember that the middle line is a high B, and then you'll be able to quickly read any music.

//Writing Music
Both my first and second pieces of music ("Tonto Takes A Shit" and "On a Rainy Day at Home, Tonto Bangs His Foot") were written by making up a few notes that sounded good together and then writing them down, and then seeing what I could add to that which also sounded good, and so on. So I pretty much just made it up as I went along.

//An Alphabetical Study in Flute Sounds
Beyond the traditional notes of the flute, it is possible to make other sounds which make the flute sound which might be used in a piece. It's possible to make the flute sound like a drum for example. Here I will list all the letters of the alphabet whose sounds when made while playing the flute make strange new sounds possible.

Scales:
Major scales start on any natural note and progress either by whole steps or half steps in the following pattern: W W H W W W H. The pattern for minor scales is: W H W W H W W. For harmonic minor scales, you take the normal/natural minor scale and raise the 7th note a half step.
A Major: A B C# D E F# G# A
F Major: F G A Bb C D E F	
A Minor: A B C D E F G A

--{My Philosophy on How to Learn Music:
+Avoiding False Paths:{
It would be very easy for someone wanting to learn the flute to be misled. There's a lot of discussion on topics like tonguing, various forms of ornamentation, and other seemingly esoteric considerations of all stripes and colors. But make no mistake, the primary primary primary skill is playing by ear. Learn that before you worry about anything else and you'll go far.}
+Use Your Ear, Not Your Eye: {
Amazingly enough, mainstream music pedagogy emphasizes visual reading skills, even though the art form is auditory and physical, not visual or intellectual. I urge you strongly to never learn a tune from notation, whether from sheet music or abc code. Never learn a tune from notation alone, especially if you are not already an excellent musician. You may not learn tunes fast enough to satisfy your otherwise healthy eagerness, but you will learn them right. Learning to play through reading sheet music is like teaching a baby to read before it can talk, and then expecting it to learn to speak by reading the newspaper. It's like going to an art gallery and trying to smell the paintings. There's a better way. Learning tunes by ear is the way that will make you an excellent musician.
}
+The Golden Art of Transcribing - Learning to Play by Ear {
If you face the necessity of learning by ear with fear and/or self-doubt, as many people do, here's a handy tip to overcome that fear: make your own transcriptions. Select and study a recording of the tune you want to learn and then write down what you hear in that recording, using either standard music notation or abc notation, as you prefer. Why does learning from your own transcription work, but not when you learn from someone else's transcription? The process of understanding what you're hearing enough to be able to write it down is the key. The hands-on task of making your transcription ends up being a much less daunting and even an enjoyable and fascinating task, compared to going directly from ear to fingers, for anyone still new to the latter skill. 

So you never want to LEARN a new tune by sight - the very act of working out the notes of a tune provides a wonderful lesson for training your ear, it will teach you to recognize pitch and intervals and probably things that I'm not even aware of yet - but on the other hand it would really be a pain in the ass to go back and have to re-learn the same tunes over and over again, it would be discouraging, and that's why you do want to write them down, and why it's okay to do that and to refer back to tunes that you've already written down. Just keep learning new tunes and adding them to your tunebook, and your ability to play by ear will grow and grow and grow, until eventually, you won't even HAVE to write them down - you'll be able to hear anything and play it. And that's how you become an expert musician.

As you know, I'm a virtuoso whistler. When I listen to a piece of music and whistle along with it I can catch all the little nuances, improvise along with it, and convert all of the various instruments in the song (including the voice) into one instrument - my whistle. Well, here's how I suggest you use that talent: when you have a song you want to learn to play on your flute, and I mean a really complex song, like a Jimi Hendrix composition, then put on some headphones and listen to it, while at the same time whistling along with it and recording yourself. And by the way, actually it can be hard to get a decent recording of a whistle, and there's a lot going on even below the level of a whistle when you whistle a tune, so rather than really recording the whistle itself, aim at recording the 'non-whistle', which is the name i'm choosing to describe the quiet sound that air makes when it passes through your pursed lips which is not a whistle. Shoot for recording this almost-whistle, then later you can listen to THAT in order to get the notes of the song as you would play it.

+Why Learn to Play an Instrument in the first place: {
You've heard the reasons that other people give. They cite studies that say learning to play music makes you smarter, more disciplined, and all of that. But those aren't reasons. The fact is, I'm already smart. I'm already disciplined. I already have paitence and concentration. The only real, valid reason for learning to play an instrument is: it's fun. When you make up music and then play it, it's like you're a bird, chirping happily up in a tree. Only a musician knows the simple joy of being a bird chirping a tune. You take your mind off all the problems in the world on just focus on what you're doing. And what you're doing is playing. You're playing music.  In a way, it's a lot like when you were a kid playing in the sandbox. You're building things, but instead of castles and fortresses, this time it's harmonies and melodies. And the nature of music itself is so ephemeral. It's like watching smoke dance in the air. In fact, playing music is probably one of the happiest activities you can do with your time. It's a lot like dancing. If you can imagine how happy a person would be who spent all his free time just dancing, then you can imagine the joy of a musician. The dancer dances to the music on the outside, but the musician has the music dancing within him. That's why you should learn music. Another thing is that music has a particular tendancy to get lodged in the subconscious mind. If you play a sad tune then it sticks deep inside you and that sadness hangs on you like a dark cloud. But if you're playing happy music, then it doesn't matter what troubles come at you, your music is like a holy shield, protecting your emotions. Of course, there are lots of different ways to go about playing music. You could make it hard work, if you wanted to. That's what the classically trained musicians do. Or you could tell yourself it was really important to learn to play other peoples songs, but you know, there's music around you all the time, if you only had the ears to hear it - heavenly music, that transcends the physical realm. And when you force yourself to play another persons song, you're not listening to that music of the moment, and it's not as fun. It's really better to make your own music. I'm arguing for this point, and to be honest I don't even understand all the reasons why I believe what I'm saying well enough to explain them clearly, but listen to me when I say that I do believe it. It's better to make your own music. Just be a bird in a tree, or a human building sand castle melodies, happy and care free. Simple. Play happy music and be happy. Make happy music in your free time. Then when you play it it's like you're weaving a spell, and that music will penetrate the subconscious minds of other people and make them happy too. Or, if you prefer, approach making and playing music like a game, whether you're playing your own music or not. Just have fun with it.

+Whats the Best Way to Write a Song?{	
I've been thinking about this a lot and I think that the best answer is to create a song, in parts, in my head using whistling or making musical vocal sounds (like 'do do do bwah da bwah', etc). Make a part that sounds cool, then make sure to record it (in musical vocalization or whistling or even on an instrument if you want). Basically, the important thing is, when you compose the music, you shouldn't be composing with your instrument. You shouldn't be composing with your instrument and there's a very good reason why that's so. It's because you haven't mastered intervals yet. When you can pick up your instrument and just play anything you hear because you intuitively know intervals well enough that you can do that, then fine, write with your instrument, but until you can do that with your flute, or guitar, or whatever you're using, you should be doing that with an instrument that you already can hit any interval with: your voice, or your abillity to whistle. Of course, that goes for the basic melody of the song. Then you develop the song further by taking that basic melody and then doing repititions or variations or evolutions of that, and you can do that however you want to. And then there's the bridge. The basic concept there is that songs need to go somewhere, so you sort of repeat the main melody or variations on that melody or an evolution of that melody for a while, but if you just do that forever it gets boring, so instead you introduce a bridge, where you do something different. Whatever you were doing up to the point where the bridge was introduced, now you do something different. Often, what you do is very much the opposite of what you've been doing until that part. Look at a song like Stairway to Heaven. The melody begins, then develops, and the bridge doesn't come until that verse "If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now - it's just a spring clean for the May Queen. Yes there are two paths you can go down, but in the long run, there's still time to change the road you're on. And it makes me wonder..." When that verse comes up, the whole direction of the song is changed. Until that point it had been relatively tranquil, and now it's a bit more agitated, and the agitation develops into a guitar solo and then the last verse "And as we wind on down the road, our shadows taller than our souls...". Get it? Bridges are opposite. I think that's pretty much it.

+Numerical Transcription (or, the Kairav Numbering System): {
I just watched a TED talk about why we learn music the way we do. The guy in it said that basically music theory and sheet music as we know it now was designed by Christian monks a long long time ago, and it was designed in such a way as to be useful for them and the type of instruments they would play, as well as the style of music they were playing. He pointed out all the weird little flaws in the musical system, like how some notes have sharps or flats and others don't (or stated another way that the sharp of some notes, say E for example, are other notes, in this case F. Another example is that B sharp, which doesn't exist, would really be C natural.) And despite having sharps and flats, all the notes and half notes when taken in the normal sequence are actually exactly the same mathematical distance away from each other. They're all a half step away, so why even have half notes, sharps and flats? And there are other good points he made that I didn't comprehend because I don't have a good grounding in music theory. He then brought up the THE NASHVILLE NUMBER SYSTEM, which is a way of transcribing music with numbers instead of notes, and that has the great advantage of being able to play quickly in any key. You write the song in whatever key, and you record the numbers which are that number of notes away from the base note of the scale, and then later when you play it you can play instantly in any scale, so it's very flexible. Now I say that's fine, but it doesn't really help solve any of my problems. To my mind, the greatest challenge in learning to play music is mastering intervals. If you know your intervals you can literally hear any piece of music one time and just pick up your instrument and play it, at least to the extent that you remember how the melody went. You don't have to fumble around guessing what the notes are, because through a knowledge of intervals you'll grasp them immediately, assuming you know the first note of the song.
So, what am I proposing that I should actually do differently than what I'm already doing? This: develop a simple numbering system for the musical notes. In fact, let's do that right this second. The notes are as follows: D Eb E F F* G G* A Bb B C C* - let's simply number them in order from D to C*.
	D Eb E F F* G G* A Bb B C C*
	0 1  2 3 4  5 6  7 8  9 T E
You'll notice there that I didn't go above 9, I substituted non-numerical characters instead. Why did I do that? Because when you're writing music, if you can have two digit numbers then you need to seperate each number with some other character, like a period or comma. Otherwise how will you know if '123525' means to start by playing a 1 and then a 2, or start by playing a 12? The 'T' stands for 'ten' and the 'E' stands for 'eleven,' which I feel is fairly intuitive. Now, imagine, you've memorized the numerical equivalents of the notes. You're always trying to keep your mind open to learning intervals, and since you're dealing with numbers here and not letters, it's really easy to know what the interval is that you're playing even without really thinking about it. If you're playing greensleeves, normally you would think of the notes like this: 
	E GABCB AFDEF GEEDE FDB
	E GABCB AFDEF GFEDE FEE
	ddCB AFDEF GEEDE FDB
	ddCB AFDEF GFEDE FEE
But if you're thinking of it numerically, suddenly it looks like this:
	2 579E9 74024 52202 409
	2 579E9 74024 54202 422
	00E9 74024 52202 409
	00E9 74024 54202 422
That's a major benefit because you will know intuitively that if you've just played a 1 and the next notes is a 4, then you know that your interval is 3, and you'll come to terms with that that sounds like. Well, you know, I don't feel like I've really finished my line of thinking here, but hopefully I've put forward enough thought on this that you can figure it out later. At this time I don't feel like starting to switch my music notation to a numerical form.

	And the colors of the sea
	Blind your eyes with trembling mermaids
	And you touch the distant beaches
	With tales of brave Ulysses

	
How his naked ears were tortured
By the sirens sweetly singing
For the sparkling waves are calling you
To touch their white laced lips

And you see a girl?s brown body
Dancing through the turquoise
And her footprints make you follow
Where the sky loves the sea

And when your fingers find her
She drowns you in her body
Carving deep blue ripples
In the tissues of your mind

The tiny purple fishes
Run laughing through your fingers
And you want to take her with you
To the hard land of the winter

Her name is Aphrodite
And she rides a crimson shell
You know you cannot leave her
For you touched the distant sands

With tales of brave Ulysses
How his naked ears were tortured
By the sirens sweetly singing
Yeah

The tiny purple fishes
Run laughing through your fingers
You want to take her with you
To the hard land of the winter

	{Mr Crowley flute audacity breakdown
starting at C2 on keyboard as lowest note, first note is D3
14 seconds in I put a 64th note in front of the long A, I'm going to keep it but you may decide to lose it later.
at 0.50 in you should do the notes AFD, which is not included for flute in this guys song because it's a duet
in line 20 there's another AFD in the background

Evil power disappears
Demons worry when the wizard is near
He turns tears into joy
Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by

Sun is shining, clouds have gone by
All the people give a happy sigh
He has passed by, giving his sign
Left all the people feeling so fine

Never talking

Whatcha gonna do?
Time's caught up with you
Now you wait your turn
You know there's no return

Take your written rules
You join the other fools
Turn to something new
Now it's killing you

First it was the bomb
Vietnam napalm
Disillusioning
You push the needle in

From life you escape
Reality's that way
Colours in your mind
Satisfy your time

Oh you, you know you must be blind
To do something like this
To take the sleep that you don't know
You're giving death a kiss, oh, little fool now

Your mind is full of pleasure
Your body's looking ill
To you it's shallow leisure
So drop the acid pill,

Don't stop to think now

You're having a good time baby
But that won't last
Your mind's all full of things
You're living too fast

Go out enjoy yourself
Don't bottle it in
You need someone to help you
To stick the needle in, yeah

Now you know the scene
Your skin starts turning green
Your eyes no longer seeing
Life's reality

Push the needle in,
Face death's sickly grin
Holes are in your skin,
Caused by deadly pin

Head starts spinning 'round
You fall down to the ground
Feel your body heave
Death's hands starts to weave

It's too late to turn
You don't want to learn
Price of life you cry
Now you're gonna die

I want you to listen, I'm trying to get through
Love has given life to you and now its your concern
Unseen eye of inner life will make your soul return
Still I look but not to touch
The seeds of life are sown
Curtain of the future falls
The secret stays unknown
1.30
Just remember love is life
And hate is living death
Treat your life for what its worth
And live for every breath
Looking back I've lived and learned
But now I'm wondering
Here I wait and only guess
What this next life will bring

Ha ha

No what the cost to manhood or to soul

Sun shine down, brightly shine, Down on all the land, 

Shine down on the newborn lambs

Mama, she keeps them unprepared, To meet the enemy, That's comin' unto us

Teach them that evil dwells across the sea, Lives in a mountain 

Like they see on TV


Down in the heart of town, The Devil dresses up, He keeps his nails clean

Did you think he'd be a boogeyman?


Oh, Mama's stuck with sagging dreams, She'll sell a son or two

Into some slavery, That's lucrative and fine

Just teach them not to criticize, To "Yes" the bosses, impress the clients

Ah teachers of the world teach them to fake it well

They do what they are told

In ancient days in other lives, long past, but not forgotten,

ABBAGAGGDEEEDEE
In Adonai and Babylon, Etruscans and Egyptians

Came to my temple journeyed to the valley of the Moon.

Deep underground where no light dared to come, beneath my pyramid,
I stood in Hell, a mortal man, between Belial and Satan,
And still before my audience entranced with stark, cold fear;
I cured or struck with sickness, death, or made insane my foes.
Here, in my thirteenth life, the mystic power of old
Returns and as I say these words, my soul again in hell.
I conjure thee,
I conjure thee,
I conjure thee,
I conjure thee appear,
I raise thee mighty Demons, come before me, join me here...

	{A Way to Power:
Have you ever read the books that I wrote centuries ago?
The Clavicule of Solomon is nothing by their side.
They lay bare secret Arts that stood the ravages of time,
And practices once more exposed that everyone should know.
You play with blood and hair and sweat and ends of fingernails,
The very things to do the deeds the Brotherhood demands.
You cast with mirrors, dolls and wax, the spells you learnt by heart,
Fool you are, you lash up storms, lightning, rain and gales.
I urge you now to find my books and read the tales and spells
That turned the whole world upside down - confusion everywhere.
The four of the Apocalypse on horseback ever waiting,
The Talisman of Set was mine - the Horsemen did my bidding.
The Lady of the Moon my bride - Astaroth her name,
Side by side we wove the spells that drove mere men insane,
Get thee hence and scour the world - seek and you shall find,
Read my books, and learn from them, and Power you shall gain! Power you shall gain! Power you shall gain! Power you shall gain! Power you shall gain!

Came from the lips I learned so well in other lives,
I swear that I will kill my fear, perform the rites, and sworn on
By my need to help the one I loved before, I'll even steel my heart

Can't you tell just by my kiss,

You unleashed plagues of famine, death and war

All of my sins have left me in hell!
All of my sins have left me in hell!
I tried to turn my heart against the wickedness I wrought
And in my dream my dear beloved mother came to me
She beg me turn my face once more up high toward the lord
But no tears came, I could not weep, for Satan clutched my heart!

A sacrifice, a sacrifice
You say you want a sacrifice
You say the words too easily to know just what you mean
One black hand one white hand are slaughtered with your knife
I know full well you haven't lost a thing to match their blood

The sacrificial knife is stained once more and held on high
The blood is mixed within the cup and drank by all who watch
You cast yourselves about, it brings a craze to feel and touch
We'll never get to power just by playing nasty games

A sacrifice, a sacrifice
You say you want a sacrifice
You say the words too easily to know just what you mean
One black hand one white hand are slaughtered with your knife
I know full well you haven't lost a thing to match their blood

When I crossed the abyss two thousand years ago
I never even dreamed so many powers I would reap
Till the point of my knife reached my lover's silken throat
The only thing I'd sacrificed have been my fathers sheep

A sacrifice, a sacrifice
You say you want a sacrifice
You say the words too easily to know just what you mean
One black hand one white hand are slaughtered with your knife
I know full well you haven't lost a thing to match their blood

Love can be seen as the answer, but nobody bleeds for the dancer
And it's on and on, on and on and on and on and on and on and on

They say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you've got to ride it well
The world is full of kings and queens
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams 
It's heaven and hell, oh well
And they'll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls (and it's all such crap)
It's heaven and hell, oh no

And push it way from the core
And a lady in white will bring sun to the night
Brighter than ever before

Lately when my demons drag the night across my eyes

I just can't seem to fight it anymore
DDDDFFFFGFGAB~
Yield unto temptation and be ruler of the world
B~B~AAAAAGF*DG
But it seems that I have heard that song before
GAB~AFFDG-AB~..G
And the voices begin to sing - Come home

I have seen some evil as I've walked upon the earth
But this is way beyond what eyes can see
Wicked is as wicked does and if I lose control
Is this the way that hell is gonna be

Have I fallen too far to rise
Been burning too long in the fire
Then it all falls down - Tearing the night away

It must be - Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams

Now before my demons roll the night across my eyes
I tremble as I wait perhaps to sin
Yield unto temptation and be ruler of the world
And all I do is let the beast come in

Have I fallen too far to rise
I've been standing too long in the fire
Let it all fall down
Tearing the night away

It must be - Fever dreams
From the outside - Fever dreams
Oh, fever dreams
Fever dreams
Ooh-ooh

Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams

We thought that it could never end
We'd glide above the ground before we learned to run, run

Ooh they say that it's over

Hiding in our corner of the world
Then we did the demon dance and rushed to nevermore
Threw away the key and locked the door

Everything that I see is for me

Breaking windows
In houses

Don't try it
The power's in one

But the knife can't cut the hero down

I'm a whore
Giving nothing
The taker
The maker of war
I'll smash your face in
But with a smile
All together
You'll never
Be stronger than me

I - I - I
Right here on my own
But I still rock you

Don't follow behind
Just leave me on the outside

I - I - I
I am standing alone
But I can shock you
I - I - I
1.23
On the edge of the blade
But no one makes the hero bleed
( No, no , no )

I am hunger
Feed my head
All together
You'll never
Never make the hero bleed

Look all around
Can't you open your eyes
Voices are calling
Killing rain falling down from the sky
Crying with nightmare tears
.15.5
Out on the street
You'll see blood on the ground
Cities are burning
Feeling the pain cutting right to your soul
Goodbye now
You're caught in his spell

Your freedom is gone
He's taken everything
You ever had
But if you're strong you'll survive
You've got to hold on
Open your eyes

Behind the lies you will see
The master of insanity
Under the mask there will be
The master of insanity

Innocent minds
They're the victims of shame
Staring in sorrow
Promises lying there
Broken and crushed
Confusion-just disappear

What can you give
To be left all alone
When there's nothing at all

Your freedom is gone
He's taken everything
You ever had
But if you're strong you'll survive
You've got to hold on
Open your eyes

Behind the lies you will find
He's trying to get inside you
Just open your eyes and you will see
The master of insanity
Between the lies you will find
that he's trying to get inside you
Out of the night into your mind
He's always right beside you

Yeah, between the lies you will see
The master of insanity
Open your eyes or you will be
The master of insanity

You've ridden on a carousel
So you know the feeling
As the ring slips through your fingers
Sometimes you justify it
But there's the sword
And you're bleeding once again
Before you're in a corner
Can't crawl away
Here's a way to save you
You gotta push
Get out of my way and push
You can turn the wheel
Push
One more push
You'Ve mastered the broken heart
And so you know the feeling
As your soul starts going under
Sometimes you rectify it
Then out of the blue
The hammer falls again
Before you're in the water
Can't sail away
Here's a way to save you
You gotta push
Break the body down
Oh push
Out of my way I'll push
You better push
You gotta push
Hands against the wall
And push
Out of my way we'll push
You can turn the wheel
Go on and push
Push
Push
Push

When I was young and they packed me off to school
And taught me how not to play the game
I didn't mind if they groomed me for success
Or if they said that I was just a fool
So I left there in the morning
With their God tucked underneath my arm
Their half-assed smiles and the book of rules

And I asked this God a question
And by way of firm reply
He said: "I'm not the kind you have to wind up on Sundays"
So to my old headmaster and to anyone who cares
Before I'm through I'd like to say my prayers

I don't believe you
You had the whole damn thing all wrong
He's not the kind you have to wind up on Sundays

Well, you can excommunicate me on my way to Sunday school
And have all the bishops harmonize these lines

How do you dare tell me that I'm my father's son
When that was just an accident of birth
I'd rather look around me, compose a better song
'Cause that's the honest measure of my worth
In your pomp and all your glory you're a poorer man than me
As you lick the boots of death born out of fear

When I was young and they packed me off to school
And taught me how not to play the game
I didn't mind if they groomed me for success
Or if they said that I was just a fool
I left there in the morning
With their God under my arm
Their half-assed smiles and the book of rules

[Guitar solo]

Well, you can excommunicate me on my way to Sunday school
And have all the bishops harmonize these lines

When I was young and they packed me off to school
And they taught me how not to play the game
I didn't mind if they groomed me for success
Or if they said that I was just a fool
So to my old headmaster and to anyone who cares
Before I'm through I'd like to say my prayers
Well, you can excommunicate me on my way to Sunday school
And have all the bishops harmonize these lines

I don't believe you
You had the whole damn thing all wrong
He's not the kind you have to wind up on Sundays

Now it is time for your fate and I won't hesitate

With hell in my eyes and with death in my veins
The end is closing in
Feeding on the minds of man

And they always shall obey
Follow me now my child not the meek or the mild
But do just as I say

So come on

Jump by your will or be taken by force
I'll get you either way
Trying to keep the hellfire lit
I am stalking you as prey
Living your life as me I am you you see
There is part of me in everyone
So reach down grab my hand walk with me through the land
Come home where you belong

	//after writing the notes corresponding with the lyrics i should go through the song and get the notes between sets of lyrics, which connect the lyrics to the rest of the song and connect one set of lyrics to the next. Then I may be satisfied with that, or I may get the notes going on in the background when the lyrics are being sung and decide it sounds better to play those instead of the lyric notes. Or I may arrange the notes such that I'm playing both the foreground lyric notes and the background melody notes (and of course the connective melody notes of the basic song), whether the connective melody first then background then the foreground, or the basic melody then the background and the foreground mixed together, or just main melody then foreground, or just main melody then background.

I'm going to fuck your life up, I'm going to crush your soul
Two demons stand beside me, and I'm taking control

I never sleep; I got a sinister plan
Your world is weak; and I'm taking command

Because i am the warlock
I am the warlock

I'm going to fuck your mind up, and you'll be writhing in pain
Stare deep into my scepter; and now you're going insane!
You try to run and hide; I'm gonna slice you in half
You try to gather up your army; now you're making me laugh!

I whisper the ancient scriptures, I'm drinking blood of the lamb
At dusk I begin to levitate; this is the day of the damned!

Seventeen and nature's queen, you know what I mean
Twenty one, a lone one, you can see the numbers run
Now you look so peaceful, lyin' there asleep
With the wings of God above you, before the spirits meet

shadow Earth is closin' in upon the lamps in your street
Lucifer goes walkin' down for you to meet
Minutes pass so slowly by the hands on your clock
Heavens door don't open, when you knock

Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom    DCBCD
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom    DCBCD

With the darkness closin' in, will the light reveal your soul?
one sweet kiss on your clay cold lips
long long sleep you'll never know
Where do we go, where do we go, where do we go from here?

There I was completely wasting, out of work and down
all inside it's so frustrating as I drift from town to town
feel as though nobody cares if I live or die
so I might as well begin to put some action in my life

Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

So much for the golden future, I can't even start
I've had every promise broken, there's anger in my heart
you don't know what it's like, you don't have a clue
if you did you'd find yourselves doing the same thing too

Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

You don't know what it's like

Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law
Breaking the law, breaking the law

I'm takin' I said I'll never get enough
Stand tall I'm uh, young and kind of proud
I'm on the top, but as long as the music's loud
If you think I'll sit around as the world goes by

If you think I'll let you go you're mad
You've got another thing comin'

That's right here's where the talking ends
Well, listen, this night there'll be some action spent
Drive hard callin' all the shots
I got an ace card comin' down rocks
If you think I'll sit around while you chip away my brain
Listen I ain't foolin' and you'd better think again
Out there is a fortune waiting to be had
If you think I'll let it go you're mad
You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'
You've got another thing comin'
In this world we're livin' in we have our share of sorrow
Answer now and don't give in aim for a new tomorrow
Act tough ain't room for second best

Hey, I'm a big smash I'm goin' for infinity yeah!

She sends her comfort comin' in from above
We don't need no letter at all
We've got a thing that's called radar love
We've got a light in the sky, radar love

No more speed, I'm almost there
Gotta keep cool now, gotta take care
Last car to pass, here I go
And the line of cars drove down real slow
And the radio played that forgotten song
Brenda Lee's comin' on strong
And the newsman sang his same song
Oh one more radar lover gone

When I get lonely and I'm sure I've had enough
She sends her comfort comin' in from above
We don't need no letter at all
